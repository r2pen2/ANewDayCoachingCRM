Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

### For GoDaddy Email:

- **Authentication:** Required

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

```

## üöÄ Testing the Setup

### 1. Restart the Server
After setting up your `.env` file:
```bash
npm run dev
# or restart your server
```

### 2. Test Email Invoice
1. Go to **Invoice Management**
2. Enter an email address that doesn't have a user account
3. Fill out invoice details and submit
4. You should see the modal asking to send as email
5. Click "Send Email Invoice"
6. Check for success/error notifications

### 3. Verify Email Delivery
- Check the recipient's inbox (including spam folder)
- The email should have the subject: "A New Day Coaching - Invoice #[number]"
- It should contain a "Click Here to Pay" button

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "Email Failed" Notification
- **Check credentials:** Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are correct
- **Check service:** Ensure EMAIL_SERVICE matches your provider
- **Check server logs:** Look for detailed error messages in console

#### Gmail Issues:
- **Use App Password:** Don't use your regular Gmail password
- **Enable 2FA:** App passwords require 2-factor authentication
- **Check "Less Secure Apps":** Shouldn't be needed with app passwords

#### GoDaddy Issues:
- **Verify email exists:** Make sure the email account is created in GoDaddy
- **Check password:** Use the actual email password, not your GoDaddy account password
- **Domain verification:** Ensure your domain is properly set up

#### Network Issues:
- **Firewall:** Ensure port 587 is open for outbound connections
- **Corporate networks:** Some networks block SMTP ports

## üìù Email Template Customization

The email template is defined in `routes/invoices.js` in the `sendInvoiceEmail` function. You can customize:

- **Company branding**
- **Email styling**
- **Button colors**
- **Footer information**

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
2. **Use app passwords** for Gmail instead of account passwords
3. **Regularly rotate passwords**
4. **Monitor email logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Use professional email addresses** (billing@yourdomain.com vs personal Gmail)

## üéØ Recommended Setup

For professional use, we recommend:
1. **GoDaddy professional email** for better deliverability
2. **Domain-based email** (billing@yourdomain.com) for brand consistency
3. **Regular monitoring** of email delivery rates
4. **Backup email service** in case of provider issues

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the server console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with a simple email client first to verify credentials
4. Contact your email provider if authentication fails
